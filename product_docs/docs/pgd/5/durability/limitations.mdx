title: Limitations
---

The following limitations apply to the use of commit scopes and the various durability options they enable.


Group Commit transactions can't yet execute DDL, and they don't support [explicit
two-phase commit](../twophase). Future releases might allow them. However, the `TRUNCATE`
command is allowed.

You can combine only CAMO transactions with the `DEGRADE TO` clause for
switching to asynchronous operation in case of lowered availability.

Group Commit, Eager and CAMO transactions aren't currently supported in
combination with the Decoding Worker feature or with transaction streaming.
Installations using these commit scopes must keep `enable_wal_decoder` and `streaming_mode`
disabled for the PGD node group.

[Legacy synchronous replication](legacy-sync) uses a mechanism for transaction
confirmation different from Group Commit. The two aren't compatible, and you
must not use them together. Therefore, whenever you Group Commit transactions,
make sure none of the PGD nodes are configured in `synchronous_standby_names`.

Currently, Raft commit decisions are extremely slow, producing very low TPS. We
recommended using them only with the `eager` conflict resolution setting to get
the Eager All-Node Replication behavior of PGD 4 and older.

Combining different commit decision options in the same transaction isn't
supported. Combining different conflict resolution options in the same
transaction also isn't supported.
