## Comparison

Most options for synchronous replication available to
PGD allow for different levels of synchronization, offering different
tradeoffs between performance and protection against node or network
outages.

The following table summarizes what a client can expect from a peer
node replicated to after receiving a COMMIT confirmation from
the origin node the transaction was issued to. For commit scopes the Mode 
column refers to the confirmation requirements of the
[commit scope configuration](commit-scopes#configuration).

| Variant             | Mode                  | Received | Visible | Durable |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------|---------|---------|
| PGD Async           | off (default)         | no       | no      | no      |
| PGD Lag Control     | 'ON received' nodes   | no       | no      | no      |
| PGD Lag Control     | 'ON replicated' nodes | no       | no      | no      |
| PGD Lag Control     | 'ON durable' nodes    | no       | no      | no      |
| PGD Lag Control     | 'ON visible' nodes    | no       | no      | no      |
| PGD Group Commit    | 'ON received' nodes   | yes      | no      | no      |
| PGD Group Commit    | 'ON replicated' nodes | yes      | no      | no      |
| PGD Group Commit    | 'ON durable' nodes    | yes      | no      | yes     |
| PGD Group Commit    | 'ON visible' nodes    | yes      | yes     | yes     |
| PGD CAMO            | 'ON received' nodes   | yes      | no      | no      |
| PGD CAMO            | 'ON replicated' nodes | yes      | no      | no      |
| PGD CAMO            | 'ON durable' nodes    | yes      | no      | yes     |
| PGD CAMO            | 'ON visible' nodes    | yes      | yes     | yes     |

Reception ensures the peer operating normally can
eventually apply the transaction without requiring any further
communication, even in the face of a full or partial network
outage. A crash of a peer node might still require retransmission of
the transaction, as this confirmation doesn't involve persistent
storage. All modes considered synchronous provide this protection.

Visibility implies the transaction was applied remotely. All other
clients see the results of the transaction on all nodes, providing
this guarantee immediately after the commit is confirmed by the origin
node. Without visibility, other clients connected might not see the
results of the transaction and experience stale reads.

Durability relates to the peer node's storage and provides protection
against loss of data after a crash and recovery of the peer node.
This can either relate to the reception of the data (as with physical
streaming replication) or to visibility (as with Group Commit).
The former eliminates the need for retransmissions after
a crash, while the latter ensures visibility is maintained across
restarts.
