## Overview

EDB Postgres Distributed allows you to choose from several replication
configurations based on your durability, consistency, availability, and
performance needs using *commit scopes*.

In its basic configuration, EDB Postgres Distributed uses asynchronous
replication. However, commit scopes can change both the default and the 
per-transaction behavior.

It's also possible to configure the legacy Postgres
synchronous replication using standard `synchronous_standby_names` in the same
way as the built-in physical or logical replication. However, commit scopes 
provide much more flexibility and control over the replication behavior.

The different synchronization settings affect three properties of interest
to applications that are related but can all be implemented individually:

-   Durability: Writing to multiple nodes increases crash resilience
    and allows you to recover the data after a crash and restart.
-   Visibility: With the commit confirmation to the client, the database
    guarantees immediate visibility of the committed transaction on some
    sets of nodes.
-   Conflict handling: Conflicts can be handled optimistically
    postcommit, with conflicts resolved when the transaction is replicated
    based on commit timestamps. Or, they can be handled pessimistically
    precommit. The client can rely on the transaction to eventually be
    applied on all nodes without further conflicts or get an abort, directly
    informing the client of an error.

Commit scopes allow two ways of controlling durability of the transaction:

-   [Group Commit](group-commit). This option controls which and how many nodes
    have to reach a consensus before the transaction is considered to be committable
    and at what stage of replication it can be considered committed. This option also
    allows you to control the visibility ordering of the transaction.
-   [CAMO](camo). This option is a variant of Group Commit in which the client is part of the
    consensus.
-   [Lag Control](lag-control). This option controls how far behind nodes can 
    be in terms of replication before allowing commit to proceed.


!!! Note Legacy synchronization availability
For backward compatibility, PGD still supports configuring synchronous
replication with `synchronous_commit` and `synchronous_standby_names`. See
[Legacy synchronous replication](legacy-sync) for more on this option,
but consider using [Group Commit](group-commit) instead.

## Terms and definitions

PGD nodes take different roles during the replication of a transaction.
These are implicitly assigned per transaction and are unrelated even for
concurrent transactions.

* The *origin* is the node that receives the transaction from the
  client or application. It's the node processing the transaction
  first, initiating replication to other PGD nodes and responding back
  to the client with a confirmation or an error.

* A *partner* node is a PGD node expected to confirm transactions
  according to Group Commit requirements.

* A *commit group* is the group of all PGD nodes involved in the
  commit, that is, the origin and all of its partner nodes, which can be
  just a few or all peer nodes.
