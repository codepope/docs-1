EDB Postgres Distributed offers a range of synchronous modes to complement its
default asynchronous replication. These synchronous modes are configured through
commit scopes; rules that define how operations are handled and when the system
should consider a transaction committed. 

The [overview](overview) introduces these concepts and some of the essential 
terminology which is used when discussing synchronous commits.

[Comparing](comparing) compares how each option behaves.

[Configuring](configuring) shows how you can use the PGD SQL interface to set up
commit scopes which manage the various synchronous commit options.

[Commit Scopes](commit-scopes) is a more in-depth look at the syntax and structure
of commit scopes and how to define them for your needs.

[Group Commit](group-commit) focuses on the Group Commit option, where you can
define a transaction as done when a group of nodes agrees its done.

[CAMO](camo) focuses on the Commit At Most Once option, which allows applications
to participate in confirming a transaction has been done and in turn ensure that
their commits only happen at most once.

[Lag Control](lag-control) looks at the commit scope mechanism which regulates how
far out of sync nodes may go when a database node goes out of service.

[Administering](administering) addresses how a PGD cluster with Group Commit
in use should be managed.

[Legacy Sync](legacy-sync) shows how traditional Postgres synchronous operations
can still be accessed under EDB Postgres Distributed.

## Internal timing of operations

For a better understanding of how the different modes work, it's
helpful to realize PSR and PGD apply transactions
differently.

With physical streaming replication, the order of operations is:

-   Origin flushes a commit record to WAL, making the transaction
    visible locally.
-   Peer node receives changes and issues a write.
-   Peer flushes the received changes to disk.
-   Peer applies changes, making the transaction visible locally.

With PGD, the order of operations is different:

-   Origin flushes a commit record to WAL, making the transaction
    visible locally.
-   Peer node receives changes into its apply queue in memory.
-   Peer applies changes, making the transaction visible locally.
-   Peer persists the transaction by flushing to disk.

For Group Commit, CAMO, and Eager, the origin node waits for
a certain number of confirmations prior to making the transaction
visible locally. The order of operations is:

-   Origin flushes a prepare or precommit record to WAL.
-   Peer node receives changes into its apply queue in memory.
-   Peer applies changes, making the transaction visible locally.
-   Peer persists the transaction by flushing to disk.
-   Origin commits and makes the transaction visible locally.

The following table summarizes the differences.

| Variant          | Order of apply vs persist | Replication before or after commit |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| PGD Async        |        apply first        |  after WAL flush of commit record  |
| PGD Lag Control  |        apply first        |  after WAL flush of commit record  |
| PGD Group Commit |        apply first        |      before COMMIT on origin       |
| PGD CAMO         |        apply first        |      before COMMIT on origin       |
