All data nodes in a PGD cluster are members of one or more groups. By default, 
all data nodes are members of the top level group, a group which spans all data nodes
in the PGD cluster. Nodes can also belong to subgroups which can be configured to
reflect logical or geographical organization of the PGD cluster.

In this section, we cover how to manage nodes and groups and the various options available
with nodes and subgroups.

* [Creating nodes and joining groups](creating_and_joining) looks at how to create a new PGD node
and how to join it to an existing or new PGD group. 

* [Witness nodes](witness_nodes) looks at a special class of PGD node, dedicated to establishing consensus in a group.

* [Logical standby nodes](logical_standby_nodes) shows how to efficiently keep a node on standby synchronized and ready to step in as a primary in the case of failure.

* [Physical standby nodes](physical_standby_nodes) covers an alternative technique of providing a standby node.

* [Groups and subgroups](groups_and_subgroups) goes into more detail on how groups and subgroups work in PGD.

* [Viewing topology](viewing_topology) details commands and SQL queries which can show the structure of a PGD clusters nodes and groups.

* [Removing nodes and groups](removing_nodes_and_groups) shows the process that should be followed to safely remove a node from a group or a group from a cluster.

* [Heterogeneous clusters](heterogeneous_clusters) looks at how your PGD cluster can interoperate with PGD nodes from earlier editions of PGD.

* [Connection DSNs](connections_dsns_and_ssl) introduces the DSNs or connection strings needed to connect directly to a node in a PGD cluster, and how to use SSL/TLS certificates to provide authentication and encryption between servers and between clients. 

* [Decoding worker](decoding_worker) covers a feature of PGD which allows groups of nodes to reduce CPU overhead due to replication.

* [Replication slots](replication_slots) examines how the Postgres replication slots are consumed when PGD is operating.

 * [Node recovery](node_recovery) details the steps needed to bring a node back into service after a failure or scheduled downtime, and what impact it has on the cluster as it returns.
