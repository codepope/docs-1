title: Witness nodes
---

If the cluster has an even number of nodes, it might be useful to create
an extra node to help break ties in the event of a network split (or
*network partition*, as it's sometimes called).

Rather than create an additional full-size node, you can create a micro node,
sometimes called a *witness node*. This node is a normal PGD node that's
deliberately set up not to replicate any tables or data to it.
